# The client networks for your systems. If you need this to be more
# (or less) restrictive for a given class, you can override it
# elsewhere in Hiera.
client_nets :
  - '1.2.3.4/24'
  - '5.6.7.8/16'

# The DNS domain search string.
# Remember to put these in the appropriate order for your environment!
dns::search :
  - 'your.domain'

# The DNS servers for your nodes

# === PKI Options === 
# Where to source the PKI infrastructure certs.  Here, we'll use the Puppet 
# agent certs since # they work out of the box and are managed by the 
# Puppet Master's CA. Note, this is only ideal in a production environment if 
# the Puppet Master is configured with FIPS mode on in the kernel AND the 
# master's hardware has a TPM.
#
# If you have your own way for distributing keys to systems, you can set the
# path on the local system here and Puppet will ensure they are configured
# for all the various services that require the PKI infrastructure.
#
# Please note that any key content changes enforced by Puppet will appear in 
# the Puppet reports, so ensure access to PuppetDB is tightly controlled.

# === SSSD Options ===
# If you want to use sssd, you can enable it here.
# Be sure to uncomment the LDAP domain if you enable LDAP below
use_sssd: false
sssd::domains :
  - "LOCAL"
# - "LDAP"

# === Purge unmanaged configurations ===
# Purge all unmanaged resources for each of the listed
# resource types. Once you're managing all the yumrepos
# and users in Puppet, uncomment the user and yumrepo types.
compliance::profile::purge_unmanaged_resource_types:
  - 'firewall'
# - 'user'
# - 'yumrepo'

# === LDAP Options ===
# Various LDAP-related settings. You *really* want to make sure that
# these are set since multiple modules use them.
#
# Remember that you can't include hiera arrays or hashes later on,
# only string values!
#
# If you disable this, then modules will not attempt to use LDAP where
# possible.

# === Rsync Options ===
#
# Several modules use rsync as a means of pulling down large
# collections of files. This provides a single point of configuration
# for the system defaults.
#
# Individual modules can be overridden as required
#
# By default the rsync server is  127.0.0.1, with an stunnel
# connecting to the puppet server (default seen below).  If you wish
# to change the rsync server, uncomment and modify rsync_stunnel
# as needed.
#
#rsync::stunnel = hiera('puppet::server')
#rsync::base : "/var/simp/rsync/%{::operatingsystem}/%{::lsbmajdistrelease}"
#rsync::server : '127.0.0.1'
#rsync::timeout : '1'

# the core SIMP modules are. You should not take this below permissive
# unless it is truly necessary.

# Whether or not to use auditd on this system.

# We want to use the puppetlabs/firewall module rather than the 
# SIMP iptables module.  This turns off the features in the SIMP
# modules that use the simp/iptables module.
use_iptables : false

# Default runlevel
#
# This sets the default runlevel the systems should boot to.
# The default is 3
